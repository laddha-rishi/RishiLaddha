# Profile

Hey there! I'm Rishi Laddha, the guy who turned a love for crunching numbers into a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX. Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Institute of Engineering & Technology DAVV, Indore, India—because why stop at just one kind of engineering?

When I'm not busy optimizing processes or making data do tricks, you’ll find me trying (and often failing) to apply Lean Thinking to my weekend chores. I'm still waiting for my AI vacuum to take over the world.

My quest? To uncover the ultimate question (Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy style). Hint: It's not "What's for dinner?"

Let's connect and sprinkle some data-driven magic into our lives—one algorithm at a time!

---

I've mastered ERP design, especially SAP and Anaplan, boosting supply/demand functionality. Certified in both.

I'm a Tableau wiz, turning data into money-saving decisions. I hate mundane tasks, so I automate everything I can. SQL and Python? Check. I've built data architecture, complex queries, and automated processes, saving weeks of work.

Experienced in forecasting with actionable models. A/B testing expert, balancing revenue boosts with other metrics. Always eager to learn more and push the boundaries!

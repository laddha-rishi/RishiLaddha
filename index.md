Hey there! I'm Rishi Laddha, the guy who turned a love for crunching numbers into a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering (Major: Operation Research) from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX. Why settle for one kind of engineering when you can have two, right? Before that, I tackled Mechanical Engineering at the Institute of Engineering & Technology DAVV, Indore, India.

When I'm not optimizing processes or making data dance, you’ll find me attempting (and often failing) to apply Lean Thinking to my weekend chores. By the way, my AI vacuum is still on strike—I think it's negotiating world domination terms.

My mission? To uncover the ultimate question (Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy style). Hint: It's definitely not "What's for dinner?"

Let's connect and sprinkle some data-driven magic into our lives—one algorithm at a time!

I'm an ERP design maestro, specializing in SAP and Anaplan, supercharging supply/demand functionality. Certified in both, just to keep things official.

A Tableau virtuoso, I turn data into money-saving decisions. Mundane tasks? No thanks—I automate everything I can. SQL and Python are my trusty sidekicks. I've crafted data architecture, written complex queries, and automated processes, saving weeks of work.

I like to think I'm a forecasting expert, crafting actionable models. A/B testing? Piece of cake. I balance revenue boosts with other metrics like a pro.

Always hungry to learn more and push the boundaries!
